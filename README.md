<h1>Library_Management_System</h1>

This is a Library Management System developed in Java with SQLite as the backend database. The project was created as a hands-on learning tool to strengthen my understanding of Java programming, database integration, and desktop application development.
It is designed to help manage library operations such as adding books, issuing books to users, returning books, and tracking inventory in a simple and efficient way.
